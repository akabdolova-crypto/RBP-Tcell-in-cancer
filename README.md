# Dissecting RNA-binding proteins' implication in exhausted CD8+ T-cells in the cancer context.
- Aim: exploring the RBPs implication in T cell exhaustion using public datasets
- How to run notebooks: run the analysisRBP.py in Terminal (developped and tested on MacOS M1)
- Current version of the script uses the Sade-Feldman (2021) scRNA-seq dataset on 32 melanoma patients
